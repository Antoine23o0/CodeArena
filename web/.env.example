# Base URL for the REST API (without trailing slash).
# When running with docker compose, the value is injected automatically from the root `.env`

# Override it manually only when you run the frontend outside of Docker.

# Base URL for the Socket.IO server used for live scoreboards.
# When using docker compose this is populated from PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL. Leave it empty to reuse the
# frontend origin and configure it only when Socket.IO is exposed elsewhere.

# Optional port used to derive the API URL automatically when VITE_API_URL is not set. Leave it to
# 3000 so the app can infer http://<vm>:3000/api when hosted on 195.15.242.237.
